<p>
The Water and Environmental Hub (WEHUB) project is an open source web platform that aggregates, federates, and connects water data and information with users looking to download, analyze, model and interpret water and environmental-based information. By combining water expertise with an open web development approach and an entrepreneurial foundation, the project will spur economic diversification and benefit both public users and the private sector by improving the access to water data and tools for academia, government, industry, NGOs and the general public.
</p>

<p>
The WEHUB also enables organizations and users to develop customized applications on top of the WEHUB web platform, so that the data can be easily shared, leveraged, or customized.
</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
To become a web platform that connects water and environmental data with the tools and people needed to advance water research, integrated management, innovation, and economic diversification. The project will begin with southern Alberta water data and information. As development successes are achieved, the project is expected to extend across Western Canada and beyond.
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
To make all water and environmental data open and accessible via the web, freeing resources previously consumed by searching for, and acquiring, those data. This collaborative approach will will enable new water perspectives while accelerating water research, integrated management, innovation and economic diversification.  
</p>
 
<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Open and Accessible</strong> – Offering a web-based platform as a service, with open source architecture, very low barrier to entry, and inclusive to everyone.</li>
